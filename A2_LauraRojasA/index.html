							<p>Currently, New Yorkers can find organic drop-off sites in all five boroughs. These are specific locations where residents can leave their food scraps and yard waste to reduce carbon emissions and produce soil fertilizer. Regardless of the neighborhood, the city offers about 400 sites that are free and open to anyone who wants to participate in the collection. However, the availability of these sites may soon change.</p>

							<p>Recent <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/assets/omb/downloads/pdf/peg11-23.pdf#page=33>budget cuts</a> proposed by the Adams Administration eliminate funding for community composting programs and, consequently, defund the operation of organic drop-off sites. These cuts are part of a larger effort to reduce city spending. If approved, the administration’s plan could affect 591 drop-off locations serving communities at farmers' markets, community gardens, subway entrances, and even smart bins, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Food-Scrap-Drop-Off-Locations-in-NYC/if26-z6xq>open data offered by NYSD</a>.</p>

							<p>Around 400 of these sites are operated by NYDS, and 36% are run by third parties that tend to specialize in composting and get paid by the city to run the operations. One of them is the non-profit Grow NYC, which operates 46 locations.This particular organization has faced the situation by organizing sign-up petitions from residents and independent press conferences at City Hall. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/anonymous-donor-saves-compost-collection-at-nyc-greenmarkets-staving-off-mayors-cuts>GrowNYC secured funding on their own</a>, thanks to an anonymous donor. GrowNYC compost coordinator Erick Menjivar said he was relieved, 'It was great news, we won’t lose our jobs.'</p>

							<p>These budget cuts came in the same year the city approved the legislative package Zero Waste Act, and, with it, ramped up composting efforts, such as the expansion of mandatory curbside composting in Brooklyn and Queens – which would also be affected.</p>

							<p>Ultimately, communities will lose one program contributing to the city’s efforts in waste reduction. Below is a map of every drop-off composting site the city would stop providing funding to.</p>
